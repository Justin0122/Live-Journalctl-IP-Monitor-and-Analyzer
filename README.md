## Live Journalctl IP Monitor and Analyzer

This is a simple script that monitors the journalctl logs for IP addresses and then makes a batch request to the [ip-api](https://ip-api.com/) API to get information about the IP addresses. The script then analyzes the data and outputs the results to the mySQL database for further analysis.
